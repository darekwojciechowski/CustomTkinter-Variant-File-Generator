Demo EEP File Generator
=======================

This script creates a demonstration .eep file for testing the Variant Generator application.
The .eep file contains random binary data to simulate a real device configuration file.

Purpose:
- Generate sample .eep files for demonstration and testing
- Provide realistic test data without using proprietary information
- Allow users to try the Variant Generator application without real device files

Usage:
    python create_demo_eep.py

Output:
    Creates a file named 'demo_appliance.eep' in the current directory
    containing 4KB of random binary data.

This tool is part of the Variant Generator demonstration package and is intended
for educational and testing purposes only.
